## App Exercise - Swimming Workouts

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Previous app exercises have introduced the idea that your fitness tracking app may allow users to track swimming workouts. Create a `SwimmingWorkout` struct below with properties for `distance`, `time`, and `stroke`. `distance` and `time` should be of type `Double` and will represent distance in meters and time in seconds, and `stroke` should be of type `String`.

    var distance: Double
    var time: Double
    var stroke: Stroke

    enum Stroke: CustomStringConvertible {
        case freestyle
        case butterfly
        case backstroke
        case breaststroke
